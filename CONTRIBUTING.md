We may request or make changes where necessary. Feedback will always be kind, considerate, and constructive! We are very grateful for all contributions!

## Important Note On Style

We are using **Tailwind** and **DaisyUI**. But if you feel the need to use **css** there are [some guidelines](https://margaritahumanitarian.gitbook.io/help-a-family-manual/contributing-to-the-repository/mhf-css-guide).

- Avoid the `inline style` attribute.
- Avoid `css modules` unless you are working on a whole page.
- Use the `styled jsx` library and follow [these conventions](https://nextjs.org/blog/styling-next-with-styled-jsx).

**Note:** Styled JSX is scoped, so you can be more free with the class names, just make sure it stayes scoped as for example in the case of sub components or a wrapper component.

```js
<div id="container">
  <div className="my-class">
    // MyComponent is considered scoped
    <MyComponent />
  </div>

  <styled jsx>{`
    .my-class {
      height: 100vh;
    }
  `}</styled>
</div>
```

### JSX/React style guide

We are building a convention to follow [here](https://margaritahumanitarian.gitbook.io/help-a-family-manual/contributing-to-the-repository/mhf-javascript-react-style-guide). As an example, use arrow functions while creating components.

```js
const MyComponent = () => {...}
```

### Soon-ish

> We are working on a visual style guide. Until then we ask that you try to match the current look and colors when styling. You may receive feedback about changes that aren't yet outlined. Bear with us!
